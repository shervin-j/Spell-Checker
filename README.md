# Spell-Checker
Spell Checker is a python written GUI that helps you to check spelling errors in your text.

# How To Use
This code is written in Python. For running this code you must install the libraries in requirments.txt. in order to do that you should run the following command on cmd(or similar commands on linux terminal):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

After installing requirements you can run the code, write your text and push the "Check" button to check if there is any spelling errors in your text.

I hope you enjoy it.
